   1. Personal Account Settings Modal
     •  Add avatar button action (member topbar) that opens a modal with multi-step form or
        grouped fields.
     •  Extend backend user profile (Prisma User + maybe MemberProfile) to store all required
        attributes (photo URL, NIK/KK, phone, address, height/weight, parent info, health issues).
     •  Provide member API endpoints (GET/PUT /account/profile) plus upload support for avatar
        (reuse existing upload config).
     •  Update registration validation schemas & DTOs to include these fields.

   2. Admin Password Reset
     •  Build API endpoint /admin/users/:id/reset-password generating random secure password,
        hashing, emailing/returning (per requirement?).
     •  Admin UI button (on User table row) opening confirm dialog + showing generated password
        (with copy) for sharing to member.

   3. Image-Supported Questions & Templates
     •  Extend tryout/practice question models to include promptImageUrl and per option image
        support (imageUrl).
     •  Update CSV parsing logic: maintain existing template + new “with image” template (two
        upload buttons or detection by columns). Provide new files in /public/templates.
     •  Update frontend question rendering to show images.

   4. Admin-Controlled Cermat Settings & Multi-Session Flow
     •  Add admin UI to set total randomized questions & duration.
     •  Modify backend generator to accept these settings, but also implement 10-session flow:
        each session uses subset of questions, 5s pause between sessions, track per-session score,
         final summary (UI & API adjustments).

   5. Welcome Modal
     •  Admin configuration (image upload + link + enable/disable + target audience). Possibly
        reuse site settings collection.
     •  Member dashboard loads config and shows modal once per session (respect localStorage
        flag).

   6. Single Device Login Enforcement
     •  Store active session token per user (e.g., sessionId). When a new login occurs, invalidate
         previous tokens (set flag, push realtime? at least block API by checking stored
        currentSessionId).
     •  Ensure frontend handles 401 with message indicating login elsewhere.

   7. Registration Form Expansion
     •  Update public register page to collect all profile fields, send to backend, ensure
        validation + DB columns align.

   8. Targeted Announcements
     •  Add audience field referencing membership package IDs or “ALL”. Admin UI multi-select.
     •  When fetching announcements, filter by user’s active package (server-side).

   9. Reporting Page
     •  New admin route /admin/reporting with cards summarizing metrics (members, tryout
        categories/questions, practice categories/questions, activity logs). Include date filter.
     •  Provide CSV export endpoints per metric.

   10. Parent Landing Page Section
     •  New landing route (e.g., /orang-tua) displaying explanation + maybe cards/testimonials +
        CTA.
